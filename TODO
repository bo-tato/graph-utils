TODO:
-  Get rid of the adjacency matrix and replace with sparse representation.
-  Add typed edges.
-  Add a node class to make life easier.
-  Add an edge class to make life easier.
-  Optimize!

DONE:
-  Create a directed graph subclass and update methods for it.
-  Add maximum flow methods for directed graphs
-  Use max flow algorithms to compute maximum matchings for bipartite graphs.
