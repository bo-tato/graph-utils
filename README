graph-utils:  a graph analysis library for Common Lisp
by: Kevin Raison
dependencies: cl-ppcre, dso-lex, cl-yacc, trivial-shell, parse-number

Implements the following functionality:

    1.  Create directed and undirected graphs with a single edge type
    2.  Compare graphs using graph= method
    3.  Bulk-add function for adding lots of nodes and growing the adjacency matrix in one operation, thus speeding up the node addition process quite a bit
    4.  Neighbors, outbound-edges and inbound-edges methods for listing a node's neighbors in directed and undirected graphs
    5.  Edge deletion and creation methods
    6.  Functions for mapping over all nodes and edges
    7.  Denisty calculation
    8.  Node degree & degree distribution calculation
    9.  An implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm
    10. Distance map calculation
    11. Methods to find all components in a graph
    12. Graph visualization using the Graphviz library
    13. Random graph generation using the erdos-renyi and barabasi-albert algorithms
    14. Clustering algorithms based on edge betweenness and edge span
    15. Page rank and page rank distribution calculation
    16. Hubs and authorities calculation
    17. Graph center calculator
    17. GML and Pajek .net graph file format parsers
